<h1> About Console Screen </h1>
<p> Hi I made this project in visual studio, visual studio is a coding software that coding engineers use,in order to use it you have to download it on your desktop you make projects by creating a folder and open it   </p>
<p> The console screen is a screen that you can open by inspecting the screen and clicking on the console button, the console screen is used for checking logs, printing and debuging and you can print on the console screen by just doing console.log(); </p>
<script> 
var first_name="Aarush";
var last_name="Mann";
console.log(first_name +" "+ last_name);
var a= 2;
var b=5;
var add= a + b ;
console.log(add);

var multiply= a * b ;
console.log(multiply);

var subtract= b - a ;
console.log(subtract);

</script>
